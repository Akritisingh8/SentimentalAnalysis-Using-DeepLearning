# SentimentalAnalysis-Using-DeepLearning
We have taken Movie reviews dataset to do sentimental analysis of IMDB using Deeplearning and natural language processing.
Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning in Python involves using deep neural networks to analyze the sentiment of text data. It involves pre-processing the text data, converting it into numerical representations (such as word embeddings), and feeding it into a deep neural network model.
